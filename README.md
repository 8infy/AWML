# AWML
**Application Window Management Library** - A library that deals with window/graphics context creation, as well as I/O and window-related events with a modern approach. Very raw and WIP.  

Supports Win32 and linux windows (the latter is very raw atm).
Currently only supports OpenGL as far as graphics contexts go.
Support for other platforms/contexts is in the works.
